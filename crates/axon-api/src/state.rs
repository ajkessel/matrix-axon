//! Shared router state.
//!
//! Handlers extract the pieces they need via [`FromRef`] rather than the whole
//! [`AppState`], so adding a field is a one-line change here plus the new
//! extractor — existing handlers that pull `State<Store>` are untouched. The
//! live-event sender is exactly that: the `/v1/ws` handler pulls
//! `State<broadcast::Sender<LiveEvent>>`, the read handlers are unchanged.
