//! Interactive SAS device-verification endpoints.
//!
//! These drive the asynchronous SAS state machine over HTTP, with live progress
//! pushed as `verification.*` frames on `/v1/ws`. Like every `/v1/` route they
//! sit behind the bearer-token gate (M7b, ADR 0029); the two GET reads expose no
//! secrets and a reconnecting client polls them to resume a flow. See
//! [`crate::verification`] for the port these delegate to and the error → status
//! mapping.
