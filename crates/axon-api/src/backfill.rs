//! Backfill status port (M10).
//!
//! `GET /v1/status` reports the history-backfill engine's disk-space health so a
//! client can tell when backfill has paused (and why). Like the other engine-
//! backed surfaces, the API depends only on this port; the binary injects an
//! adapter over `axon_sync::BackfillHealth`, keeping this crate free of
//! `axon-sync`.

/// A point-in-time snapshot of the backfill engine's disk-space health.
