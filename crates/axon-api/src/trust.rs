//! The sender-trust port the verification-bundle handler depends on (M7c).
//!
//! Like [`VerificationService`](crate::verification::VerificationService), this
//! crate defines the capability it *needs* — assembling a per-event trust bundle
//! from the durable at-decrypt snapshot plus live cross-signing evidence — rather
//! than depending on whatever provides it. The real implementation lives in
//! `axon-sync` (it needs a live `Client` to read the sender's device + identity),
//! adapted onto this port by `axon-server`, so this crate stays free of
//! `axon-sync` and `matrix-sdk`.
//!
//! Two facts, deliberately separate (ADR 0031): the **snapshot** is what Matrix's
//! evidence said when the event arrived (immutable, persisted by Part A); the
//! **current** evidence is read live and can differ (a device trusted when it
//! sent can later be revoked, and vice versa).
