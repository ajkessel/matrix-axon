//! Sender-device trust evaluation: the per-event verification bundle (M7c).
//!
//! Part A persists a four-valued *snapshot* of the sending device's trust at
//! decrypt time. This module reads that snapshot back and pairs it with **live**
//! cross-signing evidence — the sender's device and identity as the SDK sees them
//! *now* — for the `GET …/events/{id}/verification` endpoint. The two are kept
//! deliberately separate (ADR 0031): the snapshot is immutable (what Matrix's
//! evidence said at receipt); the live evidence can differ (a device trusted when
//! it sent can later be revoked, and vice versa).
//!
//! Mirrors the [`VerificationEngine`](crate::verification::VerificationEngine)
//! shape: a concrete engine owned by [`SyncEngine`](crate::SyncEngine), adapted
//! onto the API's `SenderTrustService` port by `axon-server`. Unlike the verify
//! verbs it is **read-only** and takes no per-identity lock — see
//! [`SenderTrustEngine::bundle`] for why holding one across the SDK round-trips
//! would be a lock-contention hazard on a per-message read endpoint.
